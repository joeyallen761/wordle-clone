You are given a project that recreates the popular online game, "Wordle".

You are to modify this codebase so that it is a "memory matching game". The specifications are as follows:

1. Memory matching game should initially be a 4x4 grid of blank tiles
2. When clicked, a tile should flip over, revealing a letter (ie "A", "B", etc...)
3. When a second tile is clicked, it should also flip over, revealing its letter.
4. If the letters match, both tiles remain flipped over
5. If the letters do not match, both tiles flip back over to be blank again
6. There should be a total of 8 unique letters, such that there is a pair of each letter
7. Letters should be randomly assigned to each tile

This project is interactive, as soon as you save changes, they will appear updated in the web browser.
